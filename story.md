there was a woodcutter he was very hardworking and honest.
one day he went to cut wood from the forest and whilst returning he had to cross a bridge.
oncrossing the bridge the axe from his hands slipped and fell into the river.
the woodcutter started crying and suddenly out of the blue an angel appeared in front of him.
she gave him a gold axe and asked if that was his
he disagreed and said that that axe is not his
she again gave him a silver axe and this time as well he refused
finally she gave him the iron axe and this time the woodcutter leaped with joy and took
impressed by his honesty, the angel gave him all the 3 axe as a reward.
